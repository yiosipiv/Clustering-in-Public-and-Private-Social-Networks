# Clustering-in-Public-and-Private-Social-Networks
Analyzing the importance of connection and the social weight of an individual in a social network. 

What makes an individual important?

The intention of this project is to quantify an individuals social weight in relation to others. 

Who has the tightest knit group of friends? 
Who is the most interconnected? 
Who relies on who and for what reasons?
Is an individual's public social weight reflected in their private social (think "close friends" on Instagram) weight? 
Is there any correlation at all between public and private weights?

This will be an ongoing research topic which implements:
  1. cluster coefficients
  2. triangle counting
  3. parallelization
  4. large data social network groups
